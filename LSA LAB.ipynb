dramatic four\\ngame series.  one friday, one saturday, and a good-old sunday doubleheader.\\n\"what could be better,\" declared ernie banks.  perhaps the fact that the cubs\\nare challenging?\\n     \"it\\'s pitching, it\\'s always been pitching that we\\'ve lacked,\" announced\\nryne sandberg.  \"if we can get by brewer, then beat carlton, alexander, or\\nbunning - preferrably 2 of the last three - we\\'ll know we might be able to\\nwin.\\n     \"lord, i hope we pull it off.\"\\n     the phils scored once in the top of the first; richie ashburn singled, pete\\nrose followed with a hit, sending ashburn around second.  kiki cuyler cut\\nthe ball off in left center, and threw a bullet in to ernie banks, who threw\\nto ron santo to get ashburn at third.  rose went to second on the play.\\n     christobel torrienti lifted a long fly to center, moving pete rose to\\nthird.  schmidt was walked - the cubs were absolutely refusing to let him\\nbeat them.  both torrienti and schmidt will likely draw 130-150 walks this\\nyear.  chuck klein is starting to hit very well, and he lashed a double into a\\ngap in right-center.  \"cool papa\" bell\\'s speed allowed him to cut the ball off\\nand prevent schmidt from scoring.  nellie fox was walked, and bob boone\\ngrounded out to second, ending the threat.  \\n     \"teams are starting to realize that you don\\'t have to pitch to schmidt or\\ntorrienti, and that is lowering their run total.  it puts a lot of pressure on\\nklein and dick allen (who platoons with chuck klein and occasionally spells\\nrose at first), and it\\'s a credit to the phillies that they\\'ve been able to\\nsustain their pace.  the picthers have slumped at times.\"  so came the\\nanalysis from frank chance.\\n     the cubs got that run back when bell bunted for a hit, thomas\\' grounder\\nmoved him to second, and - after sandberg made out - billy williams singled\\nhome a run.  in the sixth, ron santo launched a two-run homer to make it\\n3-1.  dick redding got in trouble in the eighth, as schmidt singled and klein\\nsingled him to third.  ed reulbach entered to face fox, but dick allen popped\\nout of the dugout to hit.  allen doubled to right, but luckily for the cubs,\\nwilliams had moved to left and andre dawson had been inserted for defense.\\nhe fired a bullet to home plate to keep klein at third.  lance parrish, hitting\\nfor boone, was walked, and bruce sutter entered.  larry bowa grounded into\\na 1-2-3 double play, but ed delahanty walked as a pinch-hitter.  desiring a\\nstrikeout, since ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick\\ntrillo pinch-running at third, chance brought in lee smith, who induced a\\npop-up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder, ending the inning.  the\\ncubs took the win, 3-2, moving a game behind the phillies.\\n     steve carlton was called upon to battle 3-finger brown saturday.  to get\\nanother righthander in the lineup, ron santo moved to first and bill madlock\\nplayed third.  unfortunately, brown allowed six doubles, and the cub bullpen\\nwas worn down even more, as the cubs tried to maintain a lead against\\nlefty.  madlock, batting sixth, had knocked two doubles of his own, driving\\nhome four runs.  gabby hartnett hit two home runs, and cuyler added\\nanother, and the score was 8-6, cubs after six innings.  the phillie bullpen\\nhad more troubles in the bottom of the eighth, as the cubs grabbed 3 more\\nruns to ice an 11-7 triumph.\\n     sunday\\'s twin bill saw cool papa bell gather seven straight hits at one\\npoint, including a rare outside-the-park home run in the second game, off\\nrobin roberts.  grover alexander of the phils took the first contest, 4-2, but\\nthe cubs captured the second one 5-4, with waddell gaining the win.  bruce\\nsutter tossed two innings for the save, though he allowed one run in the\\neighth.  the cardinals stood half a game behind these co-leaders, and would\\nconclude their series with the expos on monday.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\n     montreal at st. louis(august 3-6): 3-way tie for 1st\\n     dennis martinez is on a roll, and he continued it versus john tudor friday.\\nthe expos have a wide variety of hitters, and - while they aren\\'t among the\\nall-time greats, they are getting the job done.  after winning their first\\nfirst two games, they suddenly found themselves only 2 1/2 games out of\\nfirst in this wacky season.\\n     martinez triumphed 5-3 on friday, and williams outdueled dizzy dean 3-2\\nsaturday.  however, the cardinals refused to give up, winning 6-2 on sunday.\\nthe cards captured monday\\'s game, too, as steve carlton outdueled steve\\nrogers 3-2.  \"we\\'re really good against ground ball pitchers because of our\\nteam speed,\" remarked lou brock.  \"i don\\'t see why we can\\'t win this\\ndivision.\"\\n     the phillies and cubs may have some reasons for them.  two-thirds of\\nthe way through the season, there is a 3-way tie for first.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\n     new york at pittsburgh(august 3-6): 3 straight 3-2 wins for bucs,\\nnow 2 back - but in 4th!\\n    \"when your team is in a slump like we are, the worst thing is to play in a\\npitcher\\'s park like this,\" spoke gil hodges before the series.  keith\\nhernandez added that \"their defense takes away quite a few runs per year,\\nand it must be giving them an extra 6-7 wins.\"  the pirates have made only\\n26 errors all season, 6 ahead of the second place dodgers.  error totals tend\\nto be around 50 for the best defensive all-time teams.\\n     rube foster defeated sid fernandez 5-2 friday, and candelaria outshone\\nseaver 3-2 saturday, in a game featuring some outstanding defense.  when\\nnolan ryan and two relivers 6-hit the mets in another 3-2 win sunday, the\\npirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the\\n.500 mark.  they had been unable to several times in the past month.  bert\\nblyleven met dwight gooden in the afternoon game.  both pitchers possessed\\nfantastic stuff, and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home\\nruns - a solo shot by rusty staub of the mets and a two-run blast by ralph\\nkiner for the pirates.  the mets\\' darryl strawberry singled home a run in the\\ntop of the ninth off jesse orosco, working his second inning, after mookie\\nwilson pinch-ran for gary carter at second.  with one out and a runner on\\nfirst, lee mazilli was sent in to pinch-hit.  the pirates countered with kent\\ntekulve, placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting barry bonds in\\nleft field as the ninth place hitter.  tekulve induced a groundout forcing\\nstrawberry at second.  he slid hard into honus wagner, preventing the\\npirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon.  tekulve\\nallowed a hit, but clemente threw mazilli out at third from near the right\\nfield line, ending the inning.  tug mcgraw relieved randy myers, who entered\\nto pitch the eighth, and got one out before bonds launched a rocket to deep\\ncenter, running through the stop sign at third to score an inside-the-park\\nhomer to win.  the pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3-2 wins,\\nand had moved to within 2 games of first place, with seven weeks to go.\\n------------------------------------------------------------------\\n     san francisco at boswaukta(august 3-5): \\n    another sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule, as the giants\\nmanaged to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting\\npitching that just wouldn\\'t tire.  in fact, reported manager john mcgraw,\\n\"once this rough part of the schedule is over, maybe as early as this coming\\nweek, we may shift to a 4-man rotation again for a little while.\"\\n     juan marichal continued his hot pitching friday, beating lew burdette and\\nthe braves 4-1.  willie mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits.  rick reuschel\\nfaced joe niekro saturday in a slugfest.  the braves\\' park had been a homer\\nhaven, but this took the cake, as the giants won a seesaw affair 16-13.\\nwillie mays had three homers, willie mccovey, eddie matthews, and don\\nbaylor had two, and hank aaron, ernie lombardi, biz mackey, and mel ott had\\none each.  the braves had collected 149 home runs going into sunday\\'s\\ndoubleheader, putting them on a pace for 223, which would be 4 short of the\\nnational league record.  they were still a tad behind the \\'61 yankees\\' pace.\\nthey had allowed over 120, though.  vida blue actually got the win after\\nretiring 2 batters in the fifth.  he allowed only a run in the sixth, but\\nfaltered in the seventh.  joe mcginnity earned the save.\\n     in the doubleheader, the braves\\' hoyt wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the\\nfirst game, but hank aaron homered off bill foster in the eighth as the\\nbraves won, 4-3.  the giants took the second game, however, by a 6-2 score.\\nthe homer by aaron was a magical #150 by the braves; however, they fell to\\nthree game below .500, making a comeback extremely unlikely.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\n     san diego at cincinnati(aug. 3-5):  randy jones faced ewell\\nblackwell in the first of this 3-game series, and the padres felt rather\\ngood.  with don mattingly straining his back in the last cleveland game, the\\ntrade looked even better.  mcgriff\\'s batting average was even rising.  of\\ncourse, the bench was very poor, and joe gordon was only adequate in the\\noutfield, but these were minor problems, since the pitching was holding up.\\n     jones pitched a good game friday, and won 6-3.  mcgriff launched two\\nhome runs.  mel harder earned a win with the help of mark davis and ray\\nnarleski saturday; 5-4 was the final score.  tom candiotti battled satchel\\npaige to a 3-3 tie through eight innings before departing.  the game was\\nscoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth.  paige had departed after\\n10, and john franco hurled a scoreless inning.  tom browning was working\\nhis second scoreless inning, when dave winfield doubled with one out and\\njoe gordon was pitched around.  thurm munson doubled both runners home,\\nand the padres gamed a 5-3 win.  the three-game sweep had pulled the\\ngiants into a tie with the reds.  though the reds denied it, the highly\\nemotional series with the dodgers may have taken too much out of them.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\n     brookangeles at houston(august 3-5):\\n     another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the\\nwide open plains of the astrodome.  the astros sent joe niekro to the hill in\\nthe first game, opposite don drysdale.  \"normally,\" drysdale remarked, \"i\\nwould be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them.  i can\\'t afford\\nto with this team, though; we have to get our own runners going; we can\\'t\\nafford to let the astros beat us.\"  he then winked and said: \"well, maybe\\ndavis will get decked once.\"\\n     the fact that glenn davis leads the team in homers with six (!) is\\nprimarily why he would be decked, but it should be understood that his\\ncurrent pace would give him nine for the season.  the hitting on this team is\\na little better, but the power is all doubles and triples.  still, carl furillo is\\nthe main reason no astro home runs were hit over the weekend, as he threw\\ntwo runners out trying for inside-the-park homers.  for those unaware of\\nthe nastness of the astros\\' park, they have a 23-foot high gray wall all\\naround the outfield; balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs.  the\\nfoul poles are 355 feet from home plate, but the alleys are 400 feet away,\\nwith center field at 420 feet.  \"it\\'s as if some three-year-old threw a\\ntantrum and told his playmates: \\'if i can\\'t hit home runs, nobody will hit\\nhome runs\\',\" remarked roy campanella.\\n     the dodgers stole five bases friday, but the astros decided to revitalize\\nthe baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before; for tonight, anyway,\\ndavis, jim wynn, and jose cruz did not have to mess with their swings,\\naccording to the manager.  after poles and willie wells reached base via the\\nbaltimore chop, drysdale decked jose cruz with a pitch.  he responded with\\na two-run double, but wynn - playing first for davis - popped up, and the\\nastros didn\\'t score any more in that inning.  they did score 3 in the fourth to\\nerase a 3-2 deficit, and the astros wound up winning 6-4.  they threatened\\nto do even better the next game, as tommy john would be their opponent.\\nwalt alston met privately with the starters at 6 a.m. before the game.\\n     \"i think i know how we can beat the baltimore chop,\" he explained.\\n     \"how can we do that,\" pee wee reese wondered.\\n     \"they\\'re going to be beating the ball down, so we\\'ve got to be ready to\\nthrow on the run.  steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt, but i\\nwant all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws.  we\\'ll go with\\na shallow infield almost the whole time.\"\\n     the plan almost worked.  mike scott allowed only two runs through eight\\ninnings, but the astros got three; two of them scored when bill doran\\npushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and\\nthird.  3-2 astros was the final, with dave smith earning another save.  the\\ndodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill sunday, as nolan\\nryan walked five, three of whom scored in a 4-1 dodger win.  fernando\\nvalenzuela lost the second game 4-2 to don sutton, however, as the dodgers\\'\\nthirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough.\\n     \"we\\'re mostly a power team,\" remarked ron cey.  \"jackie and, when he\\nplays, maury wills are our only real speed demons, though a couple other\\nplays can do it now and then.  we\\'re sunk in a place like the astrodome.  i\\nguess that\\'s why they\\'re so successful there.\"  indeed, it seems that\\nbasestealing teams give them the most trouble in the dome.  the \\'stros\\nswiped 12 bases in 16 attempts, giving them 230 on the season.\\n     standings after these weekend series:\\na.l.east\\nteam                     w           l           gb\\nnew york                68        42          --\\ncleveland               65

overall\\nbatting average is that the correlation from year to year is almost zero. \\nadding to the sample size doesn\\'t seem to help much.  as a counterexample to \\nwhat you showed, consider the following two players from 1984-1987:\\n\\n               non-clutch                      clutch\\n               ab      h       ba              ab      h       ba\\n \\nmaldonado      1060    260     .245            254     78      .307\\nlemon          1643    457     .278            256     57      .223\\n\\nif you had had these two players in 1988, by your logic, in those \"clutch\"\\nsituations, you\\'d bat maldonado for lemon in a blink of an eye.  well, in \\n1988, maldonado hit .267 in \"non-clutch\" and .190 in \"clutch\", while lemon\\nhit .254 in \"non-clutch\" and .313 in \"clutch\".  before you accuse me of \\ncompletely cooking the data, there were 96 players who had 25+ \"clutch\"\\nat bats every year from 1984-1988 (according to elias).  as a simple\\nmeasure of clutchness, let\\'s just look at clutch ba-non-clutch ba. if you use \\n\\'84-\\'87 to predict \\'88 for those 96 players, you\\'d find that 27 of the\\n96 were below league average in that measure both in \\'84-87 and in \\'88,\\n26 were above league average in both periods and the other 43 were \\nabove in one and below in the other.  if you were just flipping coins,\\nyou\\'d expect to get 24 above/below in both and 48 that switched.  the\\ndifference between the observed results and the coin flip experiment\\nis not statisically significant.\\n\\nbtw, correlating players\\' _overall_ batting average from \\'84-\\'87 with\\n\\'88 gives a correlation coefficient of 0.59, which is significant at\\nsomething better than the 99.9% confidence level.  correlating their\\n(clutch-non-clutch ba) for the same period gives a correlation of \\n0.088, significant at no level of any interest.\\n\\n>\\n>\\n>>       everyone would agree (i hope) that a grand \\n>>\\tslam in the bottom of the ninth when your team is down by three\\n>>\\tis a very clutch hit.  there is just no way to predict who is more\\n>>\\tlikely to get the clutch hit based on past performance (hitting in\\n>>\\t\"clutch\" situations).\\n>>\\n>\\n>if you say so, dave.  no way.          \\n>\\n\\nactually, it\\'s technically incorrect to say that we can\\'t predict future\\nclutch performance.  it\\'s more correct to say that we can\\'t predict\\nfuture clutch performance with any skill.\\n\\nharold\\n-- \\nharold brooks                    hbrooks@uiatma.atmos.uiuc.edu\\nnational severe storms laboratory (norman, ok)\\n\"i used to work for a brewery, too, but i didn\\'t drink on the job.\"\\n-p. bavasi on dal maxvill\\'s view that florida can win the nl east in \\'93\\n',\n",

 good obp, great speed numbers, in a park which, for most of his\\ncareer, depressed offense, admittedly, no power (\\'cept against tom niedenfuer\\n:-|), but still, a definite asset offensively.\\n\\tyount?  3,000 hits, mvp at two different positions, uh-huh, a real\\nstiff.  his \\'82 was one of the great years ever by a player in recent memory,\\nand probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of wagner and banks, as far as\\nss numbers go.  he\\'s a clear hof\\'er, imho.\\n\\n>isn\\'t done, there will be little prestige in the hall of fame anymore. when \\n>certain individuals believe that steve garvey or jack morris are potential \\n>candidates, the absurdity is apparent. gee, can these guys even compare to\\n>the more likely future hall of famers like kirby puckett or nolan ryan?\\n\\n\\twell, as far as garvey goes, you\\'re right.  garvey is a \"mediot\" \\ncandidate, pushed because of his \"winning attitude\" (a minor factor, if one\\nat all), and his \"great defense\" (no errors, admittedly, but the range of\\na tree stump...).  garvey shouldn\\'t be in the hof.\\n\\tskyjack?  i\\'ve said a lot of nasty things about skyjack in the last\\nyear or so, but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk\\nabout morris\\' \"ability to win\" which is nothing more than morris\\' \"ability\\nto pitch when toronto to score tons of runs\".  at this point, morris is an\\naverage pitcher (although from his early returns in \\'93, he may be damned \\nclose to done.).  but, in all fairness, morris was a dominant pitcher in the\\n80\\'s for up-and-down tiger teams.  while 1984 was (obviously) a great year\\nfor detroit, the rest of the decade, the team was generally in contention, but\\nnot favorites.  morris\\' career numbers are quite good, and worthy of hof\\n\"consideration\".  \\n\\tryan?  of course, but be careful.  i guarantee you that someone will\\nthrow back your earlier logic about \"yount and smith being shortstops who \\nhung around a long time\".  after all, nolan never won a cy...  damn, he\\'s \\njust pitcher who hung around for 99 years...  his w-l record is mediocre...\\n(of course, nolan\\'s a hof\\'er...)\\n\\tpuck?  probably, although he\\'s got to play reasonably well for a few\\nmore years (10 years, even good ones, aren\\'t enough to make the hof, most\\nlikely).  that said, i believe puckett will make the hof, pretty much\\nregardless of how the rest of his career turns out (barring something really \\ntragic or sudden).  he\\'s very popular in the media and with fans, and\\nlegitimately has been one of the best cf\\'s in the game since he joined the\\nleague.  i\\'ve always liked the guy, and i hope he does make it.  and, in the\\nend, i think the puck will make it in.  but, really, it\\'s too early to sell.\\n\\n\\tthis debate comes up rather frequently on the net, and, believe it \\nor not, i never tire of it.  it\\'s an interesting subject.  here\\'s an off\\nthe top of my head list of potential hof\\'ers from each team.  i probably\\nleft a couple of guys off, so feel free to follow up.  i won\\'t consider anyone\\nwho started playing after about 1985 (again, too early to tell.)

 say\\n>they all came on solo hr by fred; then fred was hitting hr to tie up the game,\\n>which are just as valuable as hr to take the lead (see lindsey), and fred will\\n>himself have accrued a good .4 rating or so.  so fred and bob combined have\\n>amassed 138% of a win in one game.  there\\'s clearly a problem here.\\n\\nthe only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly\\nhow many wins the team has.  first, we are using averages over many\\nseasons and applying them to one game.  second, remember some players\\nperformance take away from the chance of you winning.  that is a\\nplayer who gets an out gets a \"negative probability\" in most cases.\\nthus, i\\'m not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers\\nfor a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game.  sometimes,\\nthey will add up to more then one sometime, less than one.  also,\\nthe pitchers\\' bad performances (giving up 6 runs) may have given\\nthem a large negative percentage for that game.  also, any batter that\\npulled an 0-4 night would give large negatives.  \\n\\n\\n\\n>>greg thinking about the right things, but his intuition is off the\\n>>mark.  closers are enormously important.  the total number of runs\\n>>value is outweighed by when they come, or are prevented from comming.\\n>>the doubling which greg allows is not enough.\\n>\\n>in another article, i proposed a test of this.  we can predict a team\\'s \\n>won/lost record quite accurately by looking at how many runs *total* they\\n>score and allow, without regard to when those runs score in the game.  if\\n>late runs are really more important than early runs, then looking only at\\n>late runs should lead to a *better* predictor, right?\\n\\nno, but really only because you have a smaller sample size.  i would\\nthink however, that the number of runs you score in the first inning\\nwould be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score \\nin the last inning.  and, realize something else a closer usually\\ncomes in in a close situation, not a blow out.  it is hard to argue\\nthat any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance\\nto those given up in the first inning.  look, a closer giving up runs\\noften means a team will lose many games.  on, the other hand a starter\\nwho gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win.  the\\noffence has many more outs to do something about.  but, i am not\\nsaying all late inning situations are equally important either.  if\\ni am down 8 runs in the ninth, it really does not matter how many\\nruns my pitcher gives up in the ninth.       \\n\\n>here\\'s another thought experiment: apply this method to basketball.  what\\n>you find is that points scored in the first *half* of the game have almost\\n>exactly no value, because no lead is safe with an entire half yet to play.\\n>furthermore, the sub in off the bench who sinks the winning free throws with\\n>no time on the clock gets a +1.0 for the game, while the star forward who \\n>scored 27 points in the first half before spraining his ankle gets a zero.\\n>\\n>does this make sense?\\n\\n\\nno, but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would\\nbe 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made.  look,\\nif you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left, there is a fairly high\\nprobability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the\\nball.  and, do not forget that somebody elses missed shots, turnovers,\\nfouls, bad defense, etc. caused a \"negative chance\" that the team\\nwould win.\\n \\nfrom reading all of the discussion on this statistic, i feel that those\\nwho critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda.\\nat first look this statistic valadates clutchness.  but, it really\\ndoes not.  cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players\\nin crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance\\ngoes down.  i\\'ve never seen convincing proof that this really happens.\\nso, if you assume there is no clutchness, then that means that except\\nfor a lot of noice, this statistic has a positive association to\\nplayer performance.  there is a way to get rid of the noice if you\\ndo not believe in clutchness.  certainly, we could find out what\\nthe average value of a home run is for example.  we may find for\\ninstance, that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15%\\non average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5%.\\ni bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just\\nas good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses.\\n\\nhow do we evaluate relief pitchers?  say john and sam have the\\nexact same pitching statistics (runs, earned runs, k\\'s, bb\\'s,\\netc.)  both had exceptional numbers.  john, however only pitched\\nin closer situations, while sam was a mop up man.  who was more\\nvaluble to their team?  probably john.  who was the better \\npitcher?  they were probably about the same.\\n\\n                                                        brian smith\\n',\n",

how many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a\\ngame? while i believe both of these guys have numbers, baseball is about more\\nthan numbers (or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers).\\nboth of these guys are proven stars and belong in the hall of fame. as does\\ngeorge brett who also belongs in this class of player.\\n\\n|>      let's be a little more selective, huh?

(but note that this type of argument is quite often\\nmade when you map \"species x\" onto \\'humans\\', and \"organ z\" onto\\n\\'brain\\').  on the other hand, some statements of this kind do seem\\nmore reasonable than others, as far as we can test them (e.g. \\'brain\\'\\nabove might be more reasonable than \\'pancreas\\' assuming no gross\\npathology, particularly if species y is a primate).\\n\\neven when you make such statements, you should be concerned with the\\nfunctioning of the whole organism, and the possibility that one organ\\nmight be more crucial for one species and a second organ in another.\\n(not to mention the possibility that no organ is particularly crucial\\nin some third species.)  however, if we are non-vitalists with any\\nkind of reductionsit streak, we will want to say that an organism is\\nnot some completely magical unanalyzable \"whole\" but an intriguing\\nprocess made up of various subprocesses that interact in ways that are\\npotentially observable.  some of these processes might be localized to\\nparticular organs, while others may be distributed across multiple\\norgans.  in a way, this is just like a baseball team, except that i\\nthink it is pretty clear that the processes and interactions involved\\nin baseball are *much* simpler and less numerous than in most organisms.\\n\\n>to say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab-\\n>solutely  that  player a\\'s team would have played better with player b\\n>in their lineup.  sheer speculation.  impossible to ascertain.\\n\\none thing that is quite difficult about baseball is that perfectly\\ncontrolled experiments are sometimes very tough to do.  but, of\\ncourse, this has never stopped researchers from doing the best they\\ncan, and sometimes deriving very powerful conclusions even in the\\nabsence of certainty.  most of this goes far beyond sheer speculation,\\nbut even sheer speculation can motivate further interesting research.\\n\\n>if you want to select a group of statistics and claim that clemens\\n>has done better [than another pitcher] with those statistics as a\\n>criteria, then fine.\\n\\nin this cases, we\\'re seeing the word \"statistics\" means \"summary of\\nobserved events\", where the events themselves can be viewed as the\\noutput of some process, and possibly inputs for other processes.\\nthus, if we have any valid notion of how the processes are put together\\ninto the functioning organism, data in the form of statistics might\\ngive us a basis to test particular hypotheses.\\n\\n>but you have to be able to prove that those statistics measure the\\n>individual\\'s contribution to winning the ws - because that is the only\\n>measure of \"best\" that has any meaning in the context of baseball.\\n\\nthis statement brings us back to the concept of fitness again.\\nfitness is defined in terms of both an organism and its environment;\\nyou might be fit in one situation and not another.  moving to\\nbaseball, it is clear that each team spends the entire season in an\\nenvironment including all the other teams in the league.  in at least\\na nominal sense, the division winners are the fittest teams in the\\nleague, in that they (on average) had better fitness scores than any\\nof their competing opponennts.  but in a real sense, there is a fairly\\nlarge random component in the performance of each team that is\\ndifficult if not impossible to account for in terms of factors\\nintrinsic to (or interesting for) baseball.  the same is true in\\nbiology.  but here is also no direct biological equivalent of the\\nworld series in basebal.  in the world series, the random component\\nmay be greatly magnified by the small number of games that are played,\\nand both teams suddenly experience huge changes from the environement\\nwhere they were originally successful.  it might be fun to watch, but\\nit\\'s unclear what it all really means.\\n\\n***\\n\\nnow just one more un-related point:\\n\\n>i have yet to see that any of you can predict a\\n>ws winner with any greater accuracy than jeanne dixon.\\n\\non the other hand, you have seen some of us who can predict the\\noutcome of the divisional races better than a random assignment of\\nteams to finishes, and maybe some of us (e.g. me) who can do this\\nbetter than the other participants in this forum on a regular basis.\\nbut this is probably only due to the fact that a 162-game schedule\\ngives you a little hope that bad hops aren\\'t the only difference\\nbetween the winners and the losers.\\n\\nmoreover, you\\'ve had the opportunity to see some analysis of the world\\nseries situation that makes the strong claim that *nobody* can predict\\nthe ws winner with reliably greater accuracy than a coin biased only\\nto reflect the well-known home vs. road effect on winning percentage.\\n\\n>the stats are a nice hobby and that\\'s about it.  there is no new\\n>knowledge being produced.  \\n\\nsince stats are summaries of events, it\\'s true that if you know the\\nevents you can derive the stats.  but if somebody is trying to\\nunderstand the process behind the stats, then the stats produce new\\nknowledge, and some of this might even be reliable, repeatable, and\\nuseful.  speaking of which, i should get back to producing knowledge\\nin a different field.  that is, of course, if i can produce knowledge\\neven though i\\'m relying on stats to do it.\\n\\njking\\n\\n',\n",

(yes, i can add. runs\\nare proportional to eqa squared; the difference between 180 squared\\nand 235 squared equals the difference to 279 squared, and i rounded\\noff for simplicity). an all-replacement fielding team would have:\\nrandy milligan at first (.282), willie randolph (.269) at second, leo\\ngomez (.279) at third, walt weiss (.269) at short, kevin bass (.271)\\nin left, hojo (.257) in center, and eric anthony (.277) in right. ugh.\\n\\nso, the total number of rar for a player is the sum of his batting and\\nfielding rar. i can rate them by total rar, or rar per some number of\\nbatting outs, like 400. an average player has a total rar of about 55,\\n30 batting, 25 fielding.\\n\\ntotal rar (bat/field)\\n\\n1. bonds      152 (124/28)  ventura    124 (66/58)\\n2. sandberg   143 (88/55)   thomas     122 (110/12)\\n3. van slyke  122 (91/31)   anderson   109 (75/34)\\n4. grace      114 (70/44)   raines     100 (68/32)\\n5. lankford   111 (76/35)   puckett     98 (76/22)\\n6. pendleton  108 (71/37)   alomar      98 (75/23)\\n7. finley     104 (70/34)   martinez e  97 (81/16)\\n8. bagwell    101 (73/28)   mack        93 (70/23)\\n9. butler      96 (74/22)   mcgwire     93 (79/14)\\n10 sheffield   96 (85/11)   griffey     92 (70/22)\\n11 larkin      96 (65/31)   devereaux   89 (56/34)\\n12 grissom     95 (57/38)   henderson   88 (66/23)\\n13 walker      94 (61/33)   listach     87 (50/37)\\n14 justice     92 (52/40)   lofton      85 (46/39)\\n15 w. clark    91 (73/18)   baerga      83 (55/28)\\n16 kruk        82 (78/ 4)   d. white    79 (39/40)\\n17 o. smith    80 (46/34)   palmeiro    76 (54/22)\\n18 gwynn       80 (47/33)   sierra      76 (52/24)\\n19 hollins     80 (68/12)   carter      73 (57/17)\\n20 j. bell     79 (42/37)   gonzalez    73 (60/13)\\n\\nnotable entries in a per-400 batting out rating, nl: top 7 are bonds,\\n177, lf; sandberg, 130, 2b; van slyke, 114, cf; grace, 107, 1b;\\nlarkin, 102, ss; justice, 99, rf; sheffield, 99, 3b. one at each\\nposition measured! mcgriff, despite +85 batting rar, fifth in league,\\nfinishes out of the top 20 due to a -13 in fielding. last by position: \\ngalarraga 39, stillwell -10, hansen 30, belliard 30 (blauser gad a 69,\\n3rd in league), may 43, dascenzo 34, anthony 38.\\n\\nin the al, much-maligned rickey henderson was worth 120, second only\\nto frank thomas\\' 124; ventura edges edgar at third, 116-111; grebeck\\nrates a potent 102!; griffey edges puckett as top cf, 93-90; listach\\nnudges out lofton among rookies, 82-80. and alomar clearly outpoints\\nbaerga, 97-73. last by position: segui 10, sojo 29, palmer 22, lewis\\n31, polonia 40, cuyler 26, v. hayes 39.\\n\\nall for now.\\n\\nclay d.\\n',\n",

progressed.  early on he had several three-ball counts, but even those\\nwere few and far between later on as he allowed only one base-on-balls while\\nstriking out nine.  in a post game interview he said his change-up was working\\nfor him--i should say so:  all nine of his strikeouts were apparently on \\nbreaking balls.\\n\\ntomlin (0-1), on the other hand was in trouble early, giving up a second-pitch\\ndouble to lead-off batter bip roberts.  bobby kelly followed with a single and \\nbarry larkin scored roberts with a sharp single to right.  the big guys\\n(mitchell, sabo, milligan) were unable to get anything after that--in fact\\nthey all struck out--but kelly managed a score anyway due to a double-steal\\nand a tomlin wild pitch.\\n\\nin fact, it appeared that tomlin was going to recover nicely from his shaky\\nstart-- he retired 9 of the next 11 batters to get to the fourth behind only\\n2-0.  randy milligan, though, had different ideas as his line-shot was\\npoorly played by orlando merced and turned into a triple.  milligan would \\nlater score on reggie sanders\\' sacrifice fly, giving cinci the 3-0 lead \\nafter 4.\\n\\nthe fifth inning spelled loss for tomlin when
